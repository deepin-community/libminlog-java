    This means applications can have detailed trace and debug logging
    without having any impact on the finished product.
  * Simple and efficient The API is concise and the code is
    very efficient at runtime.
  * Extremely lightweight The entire project consists of a single Java file
    with ~100 non-comment lines of code.
